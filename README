Forked from the source code available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mot-adms/files/adms-source/2.3/
The original SVN repo is now password-protected, so here we are.

You should be able to build with:
    ./configure
    make -j1
    make install

Also, it doesn't seem like the original author considered
parallel builds, so if you have an alias for make to parallelize, you'll have to override that with -j1.

There was an INSTALL file, but I removed it because zsh kept suggesting it as a correction when running
`make install`. If you find that you really need it, you can replace it by running: `automake --add-missing`

Maybe I'll try to clean up the build system someday...

Original author's build instructions: (for posterity)


0- Prerequisites
    0- gnu make is required (do not use other native make)
 
1- Description
  ADMS is a code generator that converts electrical compact device models
  specified in high-level description language into ready-to-compile c code
  for the API of spice simulators.

2- Installation - Unix or Linux
    0- run: ./configure - see file INSTALLATION for more options
    1- run: gmake
    2- run: gmake install
  If the installation fails try:
    0- run: autoheader
    1- run: aclocal
    2- run: automake
    3- run: autoconf
    4- run: ./configure - see file INSTALLATION for more options
    5- run: gmake
    6- run: gmake install
    In two shots:
      autoheader && aclocal && automake && autoconf && ./configure
      gmake && gmake install 

3- Installation - Windows with cygwin environment
    0- run: ./configure - see file INSTALLATION for more options
    1- run: gmake
    2- run: gmake install
  If the installation fails try:
    0- run: autoheader
    1- run: aclocal
    2- run: automake
    3- run: autoconf
    4- run: ./configure - see file INSTALLATION for more options
    5- run: gmake
    6- run: gmake install
    In two shots:
      autoheader && aclocal && automake && autoconf && ./configure
      gmake && gmake install 

4- Installation windows (no cygwin environment)
  0- run:
       cl -DYY_NO_UNISTD_H -DPACKAGE_VERSION=\"msvc-229\" -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DinsideElement -DinsidePreprocessor -DinsideVeriloga -I. -IadmsXml \
          admsXml/adms.c admsXml/preprocessorLex.c admsXml/preprocessorMain.c admsXml/preprocessorYacc.c admsXml/verilogaLex.c admsXml/verilogaYacc.c \
          admsXml/admsXml.c admsXml/admstpathYacc.c -o admsXml.exe
     If the installation fails send a message to r29173@users.sourceforge.net
     (note that there is NO strong support for windows compilers.)

5- Directory Structure
   adms
    - metaadms.dtd
      DTD of file adms.xml 
    - adms.xml
      This file defines the data structure used by adms to save parsed hdl code.
    - auxconf
      set-up files created by automake -a -c
    - scripts:
      perl scripts
    - admsXml
      source code

5- For developers (using the cygwin environment)
  Here is how I create the compilation environment after checking out adms from
  the CVS repository:
  0- run: autoheader (create autom4te.cache/config-h.in from configure.in)
  1- run: mkdir auxconf (create directory auxconf)
  2- run: aclocal (create aclocal.m4 from configure.in)
  3- run: libtoolize --force --ltdl -c (create libltdl and config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh in auxconf)
  4- run: automake -a -c (create missing, mkinstalldirs, install-sh in auxconf and all Makefile.in)
  5- run: autoconf (create configure)
  6- run: ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
  In three shots:
    rm -rf auxconf && autoheader && mkdir auxconf && aclocal && libtoolize --force --ltdl -c 
    touch ChangeLog && automake -a -c && autoconf
    ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
