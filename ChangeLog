adms-2.3.x:

 * Add new simplified constants.vams and discplines.vams.
   Tested to work with models currently in use by Qucs, Ngspice, Xyce and Gnucap.
   Whenever these headers are used, adms informs the user about the
   availability of the standard headers at:
   http://accellera.org/downloads/standards/v-ams

 * Remove non-GPL constants.vams and disciplines.vams headers.
   These files are copyright of Accellera. With the LRM v2.4.0 updated versions
   of these files are freely accessible. However modification is not allowed.
   Hence, these files are not GPL and should not be included in adms.

 * Autotools, add back support for static and shared libraries build.
   * Build shared libraries by default. Tested on Linux, Mac OSX, and MSYS2.
     See the configure --disable-shared flag to change that.
   * CMake contiues to builds static libraries only.

 * Fix out-of-tree build for Autotools and CMake.

 * Check scaling factors againd LRM v2.4.0
   * Add missing K scaling (uppercase kilo)
   * standard scale_factor T|G|M|K|k|m|u|n|p|f|a
   * Add testset (va and xml files) to test the scaling factors

 * Handle non-standard scaling factors with warning E|P|D|h|d|c|A
   Patch by Geoffrey Coram

 * Relax Bison requirement, tested with (2.5, 3.0.2)

 * Perl GD module is no longer required at build time.
   The GD module is becoming hard to install, and it is only used to create
   a few images used on the html documentation. If images need to be changed,
   run the mkimage.pl script and update the repository.

adms-2.3.4:
 * able to parse BSIM6, BSIMCMG (107.0.0)
 * merge patches from WRspice
 * preprocessorLex.l:
   * remove print to screen of `disciplines.vams`
	 * Change string recognition to allow embedded \" as literal quote
	 * Capture quoted string containing line continuation character `\`
	 * avoid spurious fatal error from an included file which last line contains
	 onlywhite space.
 * preprocessorYacc.y:
   * fix BSIM6 parse problem, string macro arg broken by continuator
     caused 'unexpected end-of-line' error.
 * verilogLex.l:
	 * Change string recognition to allow embedded \" as literal quote
 * admsXml.c:
	 * update website address on info message
	 * turn error on verbose message for mismatched assignments (WRspice)

adms-2.3.3:
 * adms.implitic.xml
	 * add all standard functions and transcendental functions (LRM v2.3.1)
	 * add `$limit` function, used in Xyce
 * fixed CMake build system:
   * enabled config.h reader configuration, checks for HAVE_ defines used on
	 the generated source code.
   * added module to search for Perl modules (maintainer mode)
   * it runs the Perl scripts to generate source code
 * preprocessorLex.l: set Flex ptional output name to `preprocessorLex.c`
 * verilogaLex.l: set Flex optional output name to `verilogaLex.c`
 * install admsCheck: this is a test program for admsXml
 * admsXml, admsCheck: link libraries statically
   * Set static linking on Linux, OSX, Windows
   * Drop DLL support on MINGW (Win32), static linked

adms-2.3.2:
 * further cleanup, no new language features
 * bump bison dependency, bison-2.6+ (tested with 2.7.1 and 3.0.2)
 * update admsXml help
   * use Git hash as revision number
   * show OS and Compiler version
 * fix `make dist` to create tarball
 * introduce support for CMake build scripts
 * update Readme and build instructions
